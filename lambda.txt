step1:create an IAM user and get its access keys (testing-user)


login into aws through vs code using iam user credentials
aws configure

Step 1: Set Up EC2 Instance
Launch EC2 Instance:

Go to the AWS EC2 Console.
Click "Launch Instance."
Choose Amazon Linux 2 AMI (for compatibility with AWS Lambda environment).
Choose an instance type (e.g., t2.micro for free tier).
Configure security groups:
Allow SSH (port 22) from your IP address for connecting to the instance.
Allow HTTP/HTTPS if needed for future use.
Launch the instance and download the key pair.

Connect to Your EC2 Instance:

Open your terminal/command line.

Navigate to the directory where your key pair file (.pem) is located.

Connect to the EC2 instance using SSH:
ssh -i "testing-lambda-lambda.pem" ec2-user@184.73.60.106




Step 2: Set Up Python Environment on EC2
Update the EC2 Instance:
sudo yum update -y


Install Python 3.8 (or the version you need):
sudo amazon-linux-extras enable python3.8
sudo yum install python3.8 -y


Install pip for Python 3.8:
sudo yum install python3-pip -y


Verify Python and Pip:
python3.8 --version
pip3 --version


Create a Virtual Environment:
python3.8 -m venv env

source env/bin/activate

pip3.8 install numpy pandas

zip -r layer.zip env/lib/python3.8/site-packages/*


scp -i "testing-lambda-lambda.pem" ec2-user@184.73.60.106:/home/ec2-user/layer.zip .



create a zip file with path as python/lib/python3.8/site-packages/

upload it in aws layer console of lambda function

paste the code in lambda_function wherein numpy and pandas is used and test it
